travis-weblint
==============

This version of WebLint is deprecated.

We are working on a new yml parsing library, <a href="https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-yml">travis-yml</a>, which is slowly being rolled out on the Travis CI hosted platform. We are also working on a new WebLint tool.

For more information about opting in to use `travis-yml` in your Travis builds please contact <a href="mailto:support@travis-ci.com">support@travis-ci.com</a>
